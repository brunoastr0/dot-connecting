# Python Pygame Dot Animation Project

This project is a Python application built using the Pygame library to create animated visuals of dots connecting together. It offers a simple and interactive way to generate mesmerizing animations where dots dynamically link up with each other.
Features

  Dot Connection Animation: Dots move around the screen and dynamically connect with each other, creating intriguing visual patterns.
  Interactive Environment: Users can interact with the animation by adjusting parameters such as dot speed, connection range, and background color.
  Customization: The codebase is easily customizable, allowing users to tweak various aspects of the animation to suit their preferences.
  Real-Time Rendering: The animation is rendered in real-time, providing immediate feedback as users make changes.

# Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Pygame library

# Installation

  Clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-dot-animation.git

Navigate to the project directory:



    cd pygame-dot-animation

Install dependencies:


    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

  Run the animation script:

      

    python dot.py

Experiment with the interactive controls to adjust parameters such as dot speed, connection range, and background color.

Enjoy watching the mesmerizing animations as dots dynamically connect with each other.


Customization

    Modify the code in main.py to change the behavior of dots, such as their movement patterns and connection logic.
    Adjust parameters such as dot size, speed, connection range, and background color directly within the code.
